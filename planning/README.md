## Objective of links
At links - We are pointer unfriendly :)

Problem - If we are using a conventional messaging software, we have to invest four clicks to send one message across two groups. That is wild...! We are here to fix this problem. 

At links we believe that there should be no breaks in communication between your groups. Thus its our job to introduce more seamlessness into your day to day communication on campus across multiple roles. We know you are very busy and we are here to help let your day run much easier!

## Who are our Users
We have all been there.. While navigating communication across several groups in exisiting mobile and web platforms sometimes the user wastes a lot of clicks or time in just entering or leaving the groups across platforms.

These users will now have a chance to use links to seamlessly communicate.

Avoid posting personal messages on your professional groups
## Why should users be interested in using links and How does it work?
Links works by providing effortless control to the user over whichever group is actively communicating. So, the window across groups is simply brought to the users attention by giving the user the freedom to type or communicate straightaway in the group without the need to bother enter or leaving the group. 

In conclusion, links minimizes the use of mouse pointrers for communicating across groups.
