## Installation

Fork this repo to make a copy under your own control, then clone your forked copy (for example, downloading it onto your Desktop). Locate the directory you downloaded, and open it with your file finder.

## Usage

To view the website, you can either use the file-open approach, or run a local webserver.

### File Open Approach

For the file open approach: right click on the "index.html" file and click "Open in browser", where you can view the file in the browser at its specified local filepath.

### Local Webserver Approach

For the local webserver approach: ensure you have access to Python (e.g. through the "base" Anaconda environment), navigate to the repository's root directory, and then run a local Python web server on a port like 8000:

```sh
# navigate to the repository's root directory, if necessary:
cd ~/Desktop/student-site

# run a local web server with Python 3.x (like in the Anaconda base environment):
python -m http.server 8000
```
